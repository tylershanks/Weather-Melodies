# Weather Melodies

### What tools were used?

This project uses JavaScript, React, HTML, CSS, MaterialUI, Webpack, JSON

This project also uses the Spotify Web API as well as the Open Weather API.

### Why did you build this project?

I realized that one of my weaker points in Web Development was my ability to fully utilize REST API's. This project gave me a chance to combine the REST principles used in Spotify's incredible API with the data received from the Open Weather API. Pulling information from one API in order to determine the search strings to specify the information needed from the other API was a fun way for me to solidfy my knowledge of getting 2 separate API's to work together with one another.

### What makes your project stand out?

The quality that makes this project stand out is how powerful the final product ends up being. When I initially thought of this idea, it was just a way to learn about API's more. However, once everything clicked together and my city searches were producing unique music, it changed my perspective on this project. In the early afternoon on the East Coast of the USA, I was searching the weather in Paris. It happened to be a colder, rainy night and "Trop beau" by Lomepal began playing through my app. It was a song I have never heard of but I could almost feel like I was in an apartment in Paris on that cold night.

## Features
  - Log in with Spotify to fully utilize the application.
  - Search for over 200,000 cities and recive information about the current weather.
  - Based on city searches, receive and music from Spotify that matches the current mood of that City based on:
    - The city itself, or the country of the specified city.
    - The current weather (i.e. rainy, cloudy, sunny, clear, etc.)
    - The current temperature (summer mood or more winter-y)
    - The time of day. Night songs will be different than morning songs.
